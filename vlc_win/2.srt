1
00:00:42,199 --> 00:00:46,202
Ah, so satisfied drinking.

2
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:50,164
Ah, so lazy to go home.

3
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:52,458
Just stay overnight, Suneo.

4
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:54,502
But Dekisugi also drank a lot, right?

5
00:00:54,503 --> 00:00:57,004
I use the "Wake Up Soon"
gadget so I'm not drunk.

6
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:57,838
Me too.

7
00:00:57,839 --> 00:01:01,050
Haha, you two are really boring.

8
00:01:01,051 --> 00:01:04,136
Why drink if you wake up quickly?

9
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,224
Goodbye, Nobita!
Don't get lost on the road, OK.

10
00:01:08,225 --> 00:01:09,517
Okay, Gian.

11
00:01:09,518 --> 00:01:14,522
Yeah, but he's on auto-drive,
so there's no way to get lost.

12
00:01:14,523 --> 00:01:16,649
That's right, hahaha.

13
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:20,194
Sorry, I can't come tomorrow.

14
00:01:20,195 --> 00:01:22,947
There is a sudden work, right?
That can't be help.

15
00:01:22,948 --> 00:01:25,408
Being an elite person
is indeed difficult, huh.

16
00:01:25,409 --> 00:01:27,451
Bye, yes.

17
00:01:27,452 --> 00:01:30,413
Goal: Go home. Go, scooter.

18
00:01:30,414 --> 00:01:33,040
Tomorrow, don't be late, you know!

19
00:01:33,041 --> 00:01:34,542
I know too!

20
00:01:37,212 --> 00:01:41,048
Finally tomorrow comes the day.
His wedding day.

21
00:01:41,466 --> 00:01:43,843
Even though he is just Nobita.

22
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:00,192
Doraemon...

23
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:34,602
We'll see the wedding
day next time, shall we?

24
00:02:34,603 --> 00:02:38,105
Okay. Let's hurry back to our times.

25
00:02:38,106 --> 00:02:41,859
I also want to meet Shizuka at my dinner.

26
00:03:19,314 --> 00:03:22,233
Birthday, birthday!

27
00:03:22,234 --> 00:03:25,444
I am home!
Mom, what's for lunch today?

28
00:03:25,445 --> 00:03:27,530
Nobita!

29
00:03:27,906 --> 00:03:31,784
I found this in your desk drawer!

30
00:03:32,744 --> 00:03:36,205
Can't we talk about this later?

31
00:03:36,206 --> 00:03:37,289
Today it's...

32
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:38,791
It is enough!

33
00:03:38,792 --> 00:03:42,753
I'm not angry because you got zero points,
but because you hid this paper!

34
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:45,673
Mom didn't teach you
to be a child like that!

35
00:03:45,674 --> 00:03:50,427
Why do you have to be mad
about this on summer vacation?

36
00:03:50,428 --> 00:03:52,638
How embarrassing it really is.

37
00:03:57,352 --> 00:03:59,728
Today is bad too, huh.

38
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:01,939
Even though you don't
have to be that angry.

39
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:06,402
Nothing can be done, right?
Because you're the one at fault.

40
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,655
But today is my birthday.

41
00:04:11,241 --> 00:04:14,952
Could it be...
Oh, yeah. It must be!

42
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:18,037
Hah? What have you
been talking about earlier?

43
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,117
I am not the biological
child of this family.

44
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:22,084
They must have picked
me up from somewhere.

45
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:24,920
Hahaha, how stupid.

46
00:04:24,921 --> 00:04:28,132
If I were their real child,
Mother wouldn't speak that badly!

47
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:31,844
After all, if I really am their son,
why did they name me Nobita?

48
00:04:31,845 --> 00:04:33,971
Isn't that a common name, huh?

49
00:04:33,972 --> 00:04:36,473
I want a cooler name!

50
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:44,273
Ah, where is my biological mother?

51
00:04:44,274 --> 00:04:46,233
You're talking ridiculous.

52
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:49,737
What are you doing up there, Doraemon?

53
00:04:49,738 --> 00:04:53,032
Oh, I'm checking my magic gadgets.

54
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:58,996
If the floor is messy, so I use this
Gravity Paint to work on the ceiling.

55
00:04:58,997 --> 00:05:02,458
Now, lots of it, huh.

56
00:05:02,459 --> 00:05:05,809
Nobita, don't hold it
carelessly, you know. I just

57
00:05:05,821 --> 00:05:09,381
want to test whether these
gadgets are damaged or not.

58
00:05:09,382 --> 00:05:11,884
Uh, don't touch it carelessly!

59
00:05:11,885 --> 00:05:13,010
What is that?

60
00:05:13,011 --> 00:05:16,263
This is the "Stick of Forgetfulness".

61
00:05:16,264 --> 00:05:20,267
If we use this stick, we can
forget what happened before.

62
00:05:20,268 --> 00:05:23,743
Eh?! If you hit Mom
using that stick earlier,

63
00:05:23,755 --> 00:05:26,649
she doesn't have
to be angry like that.

64
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,652
I wont use this wand
for something like that!

65
00:05:29,653 --> 00:05:33,280
Don't say that, please.
I want to borrow it.

66
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,629
Instead of that, you
better study harder,

67
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:40,162
so you don't need to
get another zero score.

68
00:05:40,163 --> 00:05:42,164
How can I be!?

69
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,214
See! There is more!

70
00:05:51,549 --> 00:05:54,301
Already collected a lot, huh.

71
00:05:54,302 --> 00:05:57,596
Please, lend me that gadget!

72
00:05:57,597 --> 00:06:00,391
If not, please hide this in
your magic pocket, please!

73
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:03,102
Cannot!

74
00:06:03,103 --> 00:06:06,814
How it come to this?
If she see this, surely...

75
00:06:08,608 --> 00:06:10,651
This is from the future department store.

76
00:06:12,195 --> 00:06:14,321
What is that?

77
00:06:14,322 --> 00:06:19,660
Sometimes, they like to send
sample items like this one.

78
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:21,829
Oh, I see?

79
00:06:23,164 --> 00:06:25,082
Let us see

80
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:27,126
Soul Swapping Ropes?

81
00:06:27,127 --> 00:06:29,086
Wait, again, you just grabbed it!

82
00:06:29,087 --> 00:06:30,087
Changing.

83
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,599
Exchange completed.

84
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,729
Whoa, what is this? Very weird!

85
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:50,858
So this rope can be used to turn us into
someone else who also holds this rope.

86
00:06:50,859 --> 00:06:55,028
I became Doraemon!

87
00:06:55,029 --> 00:07:00,159
Hm, hm, so that's how it is.
If we use the rope one more time...

88
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,285
Back to normal.

89
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:07,541
Oh, so this is it!

90
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:16,008
If so, can we not take it back one more
time, so I won't be nagged by Mother?

91
00:07:16,009 --> 00:07:17,801
Don't talk carelessly!

92
00:07:17,802 --> 00:07:19,303
You really can't, can you?

93
00:07:22,182 --> 00:07:26,602
Nobita! Nobita? Nobita!

94
00:07:27,896 --> 00:07:29,396
Oh, is that so?

95
00:07:29,397 --> 00:07:31,064
Are you alright?

96
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,902
Hahaha, it worked!

97
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:37,613
Are you alright? Nobita!

98
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:39,239
Yes, I'm fine.

99
00:07:40,074 --> 00:07:43,577
I have to hurry and save both of us.

100
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:46,455
Nobita! Nobita!

101
00:07:50,794 --> 00:07:54,671
Where the hell is he?

102
00:07:55,799 --> 00:07:59,051
Eh? Me why?

103
00:07:59,052 --> 00:08:02,554
Suddenly they drove me
here on a time machine.

104
00:08:02,555 --> 00:08:03,972
Who?

105
00:08:03,973 --> 00:08:05,933
You and I!

106
00:08:05,934 --> 00:08:11,522
Hey Nobita, I do not understand
at all what you are talking about.

107
00:08:11,606 --> 00:08:15,442
But I can only. Say that.

108
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:19,071
Hm, I don't understand.

109
00:08:19,072 --> 00:08:22,074
Looks like something happened somewhere.

110
00:08:22,075 --> 00:08:26,495
Yeah, but now I'm here,
so no problem, right?

111
00:08:26,496 --> 00:08:30,415
Really, you are so relaxed!

112
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:32,584
What's more important is this!

113
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,586
We have to find a place
to hide, so it won't be found!

114
00:08:35,587 --> 00:08:40,050
Rather than that, wouldn't it
be easier if you just studied?

115
00:08:40,051 --> 00:08:42,802
You are very talkative, Doraemon.

116
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:46,223
Nobita, go shopping for a while.

117
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:47,599
It's Mother!

118
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,935
There is something that I want you to buy.

119
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:57,860
Just recently, mom said you too much.

120
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:05,158
Eh? Very weird.

121
00:09:06,244 --> 00:09:10,205
I thought he was here. Where did he go?

122
00:09:14,043 --> 00:09:16,211
It's very dangerous.

123
00:09:17,505 --> 00:09:20,799
Oh, I found a great place!

124
00:09:22,552 --> 00:09:24,553
This way it's safe.

125
00:09:24,554 --> 00:09:27,055
Oh? It's..

126
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:30,934
Wow, I missed you so much!

127
00:09:31,728 --> 00:09:34,897
This teddy bear that I
loved when I was little.

128
00:09:34,898 --> 00:09:37,399
Lots of patches, huh?

129
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:40,194
Yes, Grandma fixed this.

130
00:09:40,195 --> 00:09:42,279
You have Grandma?

131
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,115
She died when I was in kindergarten.

132
00:09:57,545 --> 00:09:58,712
This is it!

133
00:09:58,796 --> 00:10:02,299
The person who's Nobita hugging, right?

134
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,344
Looks like the person
is very friendly, huh.

135
00:10:05,345 --> 00:10:09,556
Grandma always spoiled me.

136
00:10:18,942 --> 00:10:23,695
Gian... Gian broke my doll!

137
00:10:23,696 --> 00:10:28,533
Wow, what a pity.

138
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,212
This, in this way, the
bear is no longer sick.

139
00:10:40,213 --> 00:10:41,588
Grandma!

140
00:10:42,715 --> 00:10:44,675
Whoa, walah...

141
00:10:44,676 --> 00:10:48,470
Nobita is really a spoiled child.

142
00:11:11,619 --> 00:11:14,641
So you've been whiny and
spoiled from then on, huh?

143
00:11:15,665 --> 00:11:19,626
What I want to talk about is
Grandma's kindness and warmth!

144
00:11:19,627 --> 00:11:21,545
Listen carefully, please!

145
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:23,505
Sorry Sorry!

146
00:11:33,766 --> 00:11:36,768
Hah? Why, Nobita?

147
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,147
I want to meet...

148
00:11:40,148 --> 00:11:41,023
Hah?

149
00:11:41,024 --> 00:11:45,235
I want to see Grandma one more time!

150
00:11:45,236 --> 00:11:47,738
If you say that too..

151
00:11:47,739 --> 00:11:51,408
Oh yes! If we use a time
machine, we can go back in time.

152
00:11:51,409 --> 00:11:53,160
Better not.

153
00:11:53,161 --> 00:11:53,952
Why not?

154
00:11:54,037 --> 00:11:58,040
If Grandma saw that you suddenly became
an adult, what do you think would happen?

155
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:00,667
Surely he will be
shocked and fall and slip!

156
00:12:00,668 --> 00:12:02,794
If we talk carefully, she will understand!

157
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,672
You think you can understand time machine!?

158
00:12:08,342 --> 00:12:09,926
But, but...

159
00:12:11,554 --> 00:12:15,724
Oh yes! How about we just look from afar?

160
00:12:15,725 --> 00:12:17,768
We can hide somewhere.

161
00:12:21,022 --> 00:12:23,398
After seeing her for a while,
come back straight home, huh?

162
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,691
Hooray!

163
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:26,568
Let's go!

164
00:12:33,576 --> 00:12:35,827
Wait a minute!

165
00:12:37,205 --> 00:12:39,915
We go back to when I was 3 years old.

166
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,921
We're leaving, here.

167
00:12:45,922 --> 00:12:46,671
Okay!

168
00:13:03,106 --> 00:13:07,192
Wow, I missed you so
much! Home in the past!

169
00:13:08,361 --> 00:13:10,112
There's still a litter box!

170
00:13:10,822 --> 00:13:12,739
Oh, Persimmon fruit tree!

171
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,284
Two years ago, this tree was cut down.

172
00:13:16,285 --> 00:13:21,123
Nobita, if anyone sees us it could be
dangerous. Hurry and look at Grandma!

173
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:23,917
Oh yes.

174
00:13:25,128 --> 00:13:28,839
Grandma is always in this room.

175
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:32,008
Remember, yes. Well only see her from afar.

176
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,020
You know?

177
00:13:44,021 --> 00:13:47,232
Nothing. What's on the second floor?

178
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:09,004
This door has always been jammed.

179
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,298
If it can't be pulled, try to push it.

180
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:15,010
Who are you?

181
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:19,848
Now, so young!

182
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:20,932
Is it true?

183
00:14:20,933 --> 00:14:24,686
But 7 years later, her face
became covered with wrinkles.

184
00:14:24,687 --> 00:14:25,562
Yes yes.

185
00:14:27,064 --> 00:14:29,941
What the hell are you guys going
into someone's house! Get out there!

186
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:36,239
Even though it's me. Doesn't she know?

187
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,825
How could she possibly know?

188
00:14:40,536 --> 00:14:43,830
Looks like Grandma went out.

189
00:14:46,459 --> 00:14:48,710
That was me when I was 3 years old!

190
00:14:48,711 --> 00:14:52,964
How cute. The one now isn't cute at all.

191
00:14:52,965 --> 00:14:54,466
What the heck?

192
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:04,559
Nobita, don't cry.

193
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,728
It's Shizuka!

194
00:15:06,729 --> 00:15:08,855
Let's play house.

195
00:15:10,733 --> 00:15:13,360
Come on, I'll take you home.

196
00:15:17,698 --> 00:15:20,283
Nobita is very whiny, huh.

197
00:15:22,745 --> 00:15:26,248
I took the candy.

198
00:15:30,378 --> 00:15:32,254
Why are you making fun of me?

199
00:15:32,255 --> 00:15:34,172
Stop it. They're just kids!

200
00:15:34,257 --> 00:15:37,717
Yesterday they pushed me down at school!

201
00:15:37,718 --> 00:15:40,178
Don't mix the past with the present!

202
00:15:47,895 --> 00:15:49,437
Grandma!

203
00:16:02,785 --> 00:16:05,787
Grandma is alive...

204
00:16:05,788 --> 00:16:07,289
Grandma is alive... Grandma is walking...

205
00:16:15,673 --> 00:16:18,800
Dad, go to work first, okay.

206
00:16:18,801 --> 00:16:21,678
Okay, be careful.

207
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:23,888
Here's your lunch.

208
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:25,015
Thank you.

209
00:16:25,016 --> 00:16:32,105
Wow, wow...
Nobita and Shizuka are very close, huh.

210
00:16:32,106 --> 00:16:33,023
Grandma!

211
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:36,318
Have you bought fireworks, haven't you?

212
00:16:36,819 --> 00:16:41,823
Forgive me. Grandma has
been around to all the toy stores.

213
00:16:42,908 --> 00:16:46,953
But they only sell fireworks in summer.

214
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,955
Don't want, don't want!

215
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,498
Forgive me.

216
00:16:50,499 --> 00:16:52,584
You don't sulk like that, please.

217
00:16:52,585 --> 00:16:55,003
I want fireworks!

218
00:16:55,004 --> 00:16:57,714
Yes, sorry, yes.

219
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:02,052
Shut up! I hate Grandma! Get in the house!

220
00:17:02,053 --> 00:17:03,428
Yes yes.

221
00:17:07,933 --> 00:17:10,226
I don't like Nobita like that!

222
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:19,361
Hey, me! Don't be so
mean to Grandma, please!

223
00:17:25,326 --> 00:17:27,160
What are you doing?

224
00:17:28,371 --> 00:17:30,872
Why are you teasing my son?

225
00:17:32,666 --> 00:17:38,129
Um, er... all of this has a reason...

226
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,631
Reason?

227
00:17:41,217 --> 00:17:44,636
Actually I am Nobita.

228
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:47,639
Nobita is this kid, you know.

229
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,811
No, I'm from the future...

230
00:17:52,812 --> 00:17:54,145
What a pity...

231
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:56,898
What a freak.

232
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:01,528
That's not it... Wait!

233
00:18:02,822 --> 00:18:06,116
See? How could they believe.

234
00:18:06,117 --> 00:18:10,912
Satisfied, right?
You saw Grandma, let's go home.

235
00:18:18,546 --> 00:18:21,214
Okay, let's go.

236
00:18:21,215 --> 00:18:22,632
Once again!

237
00:18:29,724 --> 00:18:32,517
Ah, you were that weird kid earlier!

238
00:18:32,518 --> 00:18:33,768
Mother!

239
00:18:38,232 --> 00:18:40,066
Is he really here?

240
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,360
Geez, to enter the house.

241
00:18:42,445 --> 00:18:44,237
How scary.

242
00:18:44,238 --> 00:18:45,447
Here, here.

243
00:18:47,533 --> 00:18:49,951
Whose child is he?

244
00:18:53,622 --> 00:18:58,793
Grandma, did a strange
child come into this room?

245
00:18:58,794 --> 00:19:00,462
No.

246
00:19:01,255 --> 00:19:02,630
Hah?

247
00:19:04,341 --> 00:19:07,844
Seriously, where is he hiding, huh?

248
00:19:07,845 --> 00:19:12,724
How about this? Do I
have to go to the police?

249
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:15,727
Thank you.

250
00:19:22,985 --> 00:19:26,821
Grandma, don't you suspect me?

251
00:19:26,822 --> 00:19:27,822
No.

252
00:19:30,201 --> 00:19:33,620
Grandma, do you really love Nobita?

253
00:19:33,621 --> 00:19:37,123
Yes, of course.

254
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:44,214
If possible, Grandma wanted
to always be by his side.

255
00:19:45,716 --> 00:19:51,179
But no way, huh? Grandma is already old.

256
00:19:51,263 --> 00:19:54,140
Don't talk so pathetic!

257
00:19:56,018 --> 00:20:02,774
At the very least, Grandma
wants to see him get to school.

258
00:20:04,527 --> 00:20:09,113
Seeing him wearing a
backpack and going to school...

259
00:20:12,034 --> 00:20:14,327
Want to see it just once.

260
00:20:20,918 --> 00:20:22,126
Wait a minute, please!

261
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:30,218
I have to wait until when? Damnit!

262
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:34,305
Doraemon! Backpack, backpack!

263
00:20:34,306 --> 00:20:36,683
What the heck? Backpack?

264
00:20:36,684 --> 00:20:38,977
I want to get my backpack!

265
00:20:41,647 --> 00:20:43,523
Backpack, backpack!

266
00:20:46,318 --> 00:20:47,944
Just stop it already!

267
00:20:58,706 --> 00:21:00,331
Grandma.

268
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:02,959
Oh...

269
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,964
Maybe you doesn't
believe it, but I'm Nobita.

270
00:21:09,216 --> 00:21:12,135
That is true.

271
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:16,347
From earlier Grandma thought so too.

272
00:21:17,099 --> 00:21:20,101
You believe it?
Don't doubt it at all?

273
00:21:21,312 --> 00:21:25,815
Who doubts Nobita's talk?

274
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:27,984
Grandma!

275
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:36,618
There, there. You are so spoiled, huh.

276
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:46,502
After seeing you in elementary
school, Grandma thought.

277
00:21:47,963 --> 00:21:54,218
Grandma wants to see your bride just once.

278
00:21:57,598 --> 00:22:01,517
I understand, Grandma.
I'll show my bride to you.

279
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:05,730
Wait for me, yes, Grandma.

280
00:22:05,731 --> 00:22:06,731
Nobita.

281
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:08,232
Doraemon!

282
00:22:08,233 --> 00:22:10,735
Grandma believes you!

283
00:22:10,736 --> 00:22:13,613
Yes! Look, I want to show
Grandma a look at the future.

284
00:22:15,199 --> 00:22:19,243
But is it alright, making
a promise like that?

285
00:22:20,245 --> 00:22:22,997
The future can still change!

286
00:22:22,998 --> 00:22:26,125
But recently we saw my future, right?

287
00:22:26,126 --> 00:22:32,423
We can't say for sure that you
are 100% going to marry Shizuka.

288
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:36,761
Oh yes. Time Television!

289
00:22:36,804 --> 00:22:38,262
Take out Time Television!

290
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:40,056
Yes yes.

291
00:22:41,892 --> 00:22:47,146
The wedding venue was at
the Prince Melon Hotel, right?

292
00:22:47,147 --> 00:22:49,399
Is it alright?

293
00:22:58,325 --> 00:23:00,702
It can't be. Not connected, here.

294
00:23:00,703 --> 00:23:03,413
If he doesn't come quickly
it could be bad, right?

295
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:06,582
What is Nobita doing, anyway?

296
00:23:06,667 --> 00:23:09,502
Ah, that's right!

297
00:23:09,503 --> 00:23:12,422
Until the last second it was too late.

298
00:23:12,423 --> 00:23:14,549
How pathetic.

299
00:23:14,675 --> 00:23:17,802
He couldn't not have come, could he?

300
00:23:17,803 --> 00:23:23,891
But there are stories, where the bride
and groom run away on their wedding day...

301
00:23:25,978 --> 00:23:28,062
No way, right?

302
00:23:28,063 --> 00:23:33,901
Nobita... Nobita, is everything okay?

303
00:23:34,528 --> 00:23:35,737
Grandma!

304
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:38,072
Good afternoon, I am Doraemon.

305
00:23:38,157 --> 00:23:41,325
Yes, good afternoon.

306
00:23:41,326 --> 00:23:43,703
Doraemon who brought me here.

307
00:23:43,787 --> 00:23:47,707
If so, thank you, yes, good raccoon.

308
00:23:49,418 --> 00:23:51,794
I'm not a raccoon, you know.

309
00:23:51,795 --> 00:23:55,214
Grandma wait a little longer, yes.

310
00:23:55,215 --> 00:23:57,800
I will definitely meet
Grandma with my bride.

311
00:23:58,302 --> 00:24:01,471
Isn't it a hassle?

312
00:24:01,513 --> 00:24:05,808
Grandma has made strange wishes.

313
00:24:05,809 --> 00:24:11,189
It is okay. I just need a little more time.

314
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:13,733
A little bit more! But
there is no problem, really.

315
00:24:13,734 --> 00:24:19,238
Oh, I see? Then just slow down.

316
00:24:19,281 --> 00:24:19,822
Okay!

317
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:27,330
Grandma will wait here.

318
00:24:31,710 --> 00:24:34,796
We'll be home soon!

319
00:24:38,008 --> 00:24:40,092
Let's go to wedding day!

320
00:24:40,093 --> 00:24:44,931
It's about you, so we don't know
what problem you created this time.

321
00:25:00,906 --> 00:25:04,534
Ah, it's raining.

322
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,410
Nobita, hurry up!

323
00:25:06,411 --> 00:25:07,203
Okay!

324
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,678
Let's hide there.

325
00:25:36,191 --> 00:25:40,027
Maybe he got lost inside the hotel.

326
00:25:40,028 --> 00:25:42,488
Maybe. Let us find!

327
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:43,823
Come on, let's follow them.

328
00:25:44,575 --> 00:25:45,908
Shizuka!

329
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:49,453
I can't just stand by.

330
00:25:51,206 --> 00:25:52,748
How beautiful!

331
00:25:52,749 --> 00:25:55,084
Just leave it to us!

332
00:25:55,085 --> 00:25:56,752
Where's Nobita?

333
00:25:56,753 --> 00:26:01,007
Sorry, Shizuka. Also sorry to your parents.

334
00:26:01,008 --> 00:26:04,594
It is okay. We're just worried.

335
00:26:04,595 --> 00:26:06,512
Let's go there, get closer.

336
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:07,597
Okay.

337
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:13,227
Where is the boy?
Even though he came out before us.

338
00:26:13,228 --> 00:26:16,397
As long as there is no accident, it's okay.

339
00:26:16,398 --> 00:26:19,609
But that kid was so careless.

340
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:24,655
There is currently no news of
any accidents around here at all.

341
00:26:27,034 --> 00:26:31,245
I wonder why, Nobita?

342
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,751
Um, it looks like you guys are worried.

343
00:26:36,752 --> 00:26:39,420
But the time is near...

344
00:26:40,756 --> 00:26:43,925
Geez, why didn't he come?

345
00:26:43,926 --> 00:26:47,011
So it's true. He didn't have
confidence in himself, so he ran away.

346
00:26:47,012 --> 00:26:48,846
It can't be that!

347
00:26:51,516 --> 00:26:53,851
Nobita will definitely come!

348
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:03,945
What is this? How about this?
Troublesome for everyone like this...

349
00:27:03,946 --> 00:27:09,617
Will the marriage be canceled?
Do something, please, Doraemon!

350
00:27:09,618 --> 00:27:11,911
Only you can replace, right?

351
00:27:13,163 --> 00:27:16,165
Before you have to wear
this and become an adult.

352
00:27:16,166 --> 00:27:18,459
No, no, I can't!

353
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,586
There is only this way!

354
00:27:20,587 --> 00:27:22,254
I can't!

355
00:27:22,255 --> 00:27:23,631
Get caught!

356
00:27:31,807 --> 00:27:33,432
I will follow you, really.

357
00:27:34,226 --> 00:27:37,561
I don't understand anything about marriage!

358
00:27:37,562 --> 00:27:38,813
Nobita!

359
00:27:40,065 --> 00:27:43,609
Nobita! What are you doing until this time?

360
00:27:45,696 --> 00:27:48,698
Nobiita, are you okay? What happened?

361
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:53,703
Um...

362
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:58,332
Oh yeah, l-l got lost on the way.

363
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:04,297
That's right.

364
00:28:04,298 --> 00:28:06,132
He really is Nobita.

365
00:28:07,342 --> 00:28:10,845
Come on, everyone in the
party room. Please enter.

366
00:28:10,846 --> 00:28:11,929
Please.

367
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:13,639
"Small Light".

368
00:28:55,766 --> 00:28:57,808
Hey, look at that.

369
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:03,773
Nobita's teeth are grinding.

370
00:29:07,027 --> 00:29:09,320
Is it alright?

371
00:29:10,739 --> 00:29:12,823
I'm here, really.

372
00:29:13,992 --> 00:29:16,911
That's very worrying.

373
00:29:16,912 --> 00:29:19,246
Start, that's it.

374
00:30:08,672 --> 00:30:16,971
Nobita, do you vow to marry Shizuka
and love her in good times and bad times?

375
00:30:16,972 --> 00:30:20,641
Vow to be with her until the end?

376
00:30:25,605 --> 00:30:28,399
Nobita, do you swear?

377
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:30,025
Are you alright?

378
00:30:33,405 --> 00:30:36,449
Ah, his head is empty.

379
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:38,200
What should I do?

380
00:30:38,201 --> 00:30:39,034
Oh yes!

381
00:30:45,792 --> 00:30:47,918
Oh, sorry!

382
00:30:50,422 --> 00:30:52,047
It's fine.

383
00:30:54,134 --> 00:30:57,052
I swear!

384
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:00,639
Is it okay if I do it?

385
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,267
The real one didn't come,
so it can't be helped, right?

386
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:08,481
It feels so weird!

387
00:31:17,908 --> 00:31:21,285
Now is the time for our bride
and groom to kiss each other.

388
00:31:21,286 --> 00:31:23,329
Kiss?

389
00:31:25,916 --> 00:31:29,335
Nobita?

390
00:31:41,181 --> 00:31:45,184
Wow, all this can be eaten, right?

391
00:31:45,185 --> 00:31:49,939
Nobita, you are really relaxed,
after making a fuss like that.

392
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:52,441
How delicious!

393
00:31:53,818 --> 00:31:55,528
Hey, Nobita.

394
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:57,821
If you are too excited you
can get caught, you know!

395
00:31:57,822 --> 00:31:59,281
Congratulations, yes, Shizuka.

396
00:31:59,282 --> 00:32:01,116
Thank you.

397
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,122
Did I catch a cold, okay?

398
00:32:09,084 --> 00:32:12,211
Everyone, please pay attention.

399
00:32:12,212 --> 00:32:17,341
Our bride and groom are
going to cut the cake now.

400
00:32:17,342 --> 00:32:23,013
First, let's make the
cake here. Please watch it.

401
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,349
Those who want to see
closely are also allowed.

402
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:27,017
Let's go.

403
00:32:29,646 --> 00:32:33,983
I couldn't believe it had rained suddenly.

404
00:32:33,984 --> 00:32:38,821
But it's okay. This is a gardening
party room with a see-through roof.

405
00:32:38,822 --> 00:32:43,242
We are given the use of this room because
the owner is an acquaintance of my father.

406
00:32:49,749 --> 00:32:51,542
Great! Great!

407
00:32:57,632 --> 00:33:00,342
Looks delicious.

408
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,054
Hugh!

409
00:33:04,055 --> 00:33:10,519
The cake is finished, please cut it.

410
00:33:15,817 --> 00:33:16,609
'Hah?

411
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:17,610
What is wrong?

412
00:33:17,611 --> 00:33:19,820
There is only one knife, you know.

413
00:33:19,821 --> 00:33:23,741
What are you saying?
We'll both hold the knife.

414
00:33:23,742 --> 00:33:26,035
Hehe, that's right, yeah.

415
00:33:26,036 --> 00:33:29,663
Nobita, cut it quickly!

416
00:33:29,664 --> 00:33:36,086
This cake cutting will be the first
activity the couple will do together.

417
00:33:36,171 --> 00:33:40,132
Nobita, look here, please!

418
00:33:41,718 --> 00:33:46,805
Nobita, Shizuka,
congratulations on your marriage.

419
00:33:46,806 --> 00:33:49,850
Even though you can only
get 0 points in the past...

420
00:33:49,893 --> 00:33:55,189
I'm happy you can be a good
man and get married today.

421
00:33:57,025 --> 00:34:00,944
Now, marriage is really fun, huh...

422
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:11,955
Oh, right, Shizuka became suspicious.

423
00:34:11,956 --> 00:34:14,416
Eh, really?

424
00:34:14,417 --> 00:34:19,922
Now, let us hear the remarks from
our groom, Nobita Nobi.

425
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:24,218
Oh, okay, remarks, right?

426
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:32,643
Good afternoon!

427
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,857
Ah? Why? What is wrong?

428
00:34:38,858 --> 00:34:43,487
Not good afternoon.
You've thought about the speech, right?

429
00:34:43,488 --> 00:34:46,532
Eh? Speech?

430
00:34:46,533 --> 00:34:51,412
Oh, yeah, so you mean that, huh?

431
00:34:52,997 --> 00:34:56,125
Where will I put it?

432
00:34:56,126 --> 00:34:58,627
I don't know, you know.

433
00:34:59,838 --> 00:35:03,257
If I'm not mistaken... here, right?

434
00:35:03,258 --> 00:35:06,510
No, this is it?

435
00:35:06,511 --> 00:35:08,011
There can't be.

436
00:35:09,764 --> 00:35:11,807
Oh yes!

437
00:35:11,808 --> 00:35:18,105
Hahaha, how could I forget that...
Looks like I left it in the waiting room.

438
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:20,524
I'll take it first, yes!

439
00:35:22,569 --> 00:35:26,488
! 11 Looks like our groom
has to get ready first.

440
00:35:26,489 --> 00:35:28,449
Let's wait.

441
00:35:31,286 --> 00:35:33,746
We're really sorry...

442
00:35:35,915 --> 00:35:38,709
The bride and groom are such a pain.

443
00:35:38,710 --> 00:35:41,044
Wait a minute, give me the mic.

444
00:35:48,219 --> 00:35:52,639
Everyone! While waiting
for Nobita to return...

445
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:57,978
I, as his best friend,
will sing for all of you.

446
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:00,230
Hey... Wait... Sorry, huh...

447
00:36:00,231 --> 00:36:02,816
Gian, let's go back to the seats.

448
00:36:02,817 --> 00:36:04,777
Shut up, leave me alone!

449
00:36:04,778 --> 00:36:05,778
Let's just have a drink.

450
00:36:05,779 --> 00:36:07,821
Music, start!

451
00:36:12,577 --> 00:36:15,954
Buttobasu denjarasu!
Am strong and dangerous!

452
00:36:16,247 --> 00:36:18,290
Ore Gian!
I am Gian!

453
00:36:18,291 --> 00:36:21,335
Ittoushou. Addokkoishou! I beat everyone!

454
00:36:21,336 --> 00:36:25,088
What are you doing? Gian is singing!

455
00:36:26,299 --> 00:36:30,803
Even here too, the singing
can break your head!

456
00:36:33,097 --> 00:36:36,892
The only way we have
is to find my adult self!

457
00:36:36,893 --> 00:36:40,604
At this rate, the wedding
party could be ruined!

458
00:36:40,605 --> 00:36:43,857
Nobita, go back quickly!

459
00:36:43,858 --> 00:36:46,401
I can't! I don't know
what greeting speech is!

460
00:36:46,402 --> 00:36:48,612
You just need to talk
about yourself, right?

461
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:54,493
I can't! We have to find the grown me!

462
00:37:03,127 --> 00:37:08,173
By the way, isn't the greeting speech
"Good Morning" or "Good Afternoon", huh?

463
00:37:08,258 --> 00:37:13,220
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

464
00:37:13,221 --> 00:37:17,849
Be thankful? They Always
get mad when I get 0 points!

465
00:37:17,850 --> 00:37:20,561
Impossible impossible!

466
00:37:20,562 --> 00:37:22,646
You're still talking about that.

467
00:37:25,817 --> 00:37:29,194
He's nowhere.

468
00:37:29,195 --> 00:37:32,155
Oh, yeah, let's just use the search stick.

469
00:37:32,156 --> 00:37:33,490
What is that?

470
00:37:33,491 --> 00:37:37,035
The stick can be a signpost
for the person we want to find.

471
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:39,580
Heh, very practical.

472
00:37:46,337 --> 00:37:47,045
Why?

473
00:37:47,463 --> 00:37:50,424
Remember when we came here?

474
00:37:52,677 --> 00:37:55,345
Tidying up magic gadgets.

475
00:37:59,934 --> 00:38:04,563
You were in a hurry, I was
panicking too, that's why I missed a lot.

476
00:38:04,564 --> 00:38:07,524
How about we go back to the
original world and take it first?

477
00:38:07,525 --> 00:38:09,443
We don't have time.

478
00:38:09,444 --> 00:38:11,528
Don’t worry.

479
00:38:12,405 --> 00:38:15,574
For example, we leave at 2.

480
00:38:17,702 --> 00:38:21,038
We go back to the origin
and waste 1 hour there.

481
00:38:21,039 --> 00:38:23,206
Keep going back to the future.

482
00:38:25,043 --> 00:38:31,048
When we go out we put it in 5
minutes, so it's 2 past 5 o'clock.

483
00:38:31,049 --> 00:38:34,051
Finally we only waste 5 minutes.

484
00:38:34,052 --> 00:38:36,928
Doraemon, you are so smart.

485
00:38:36,929 --> 00:38:44,728
Not really, ah.

486
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:46,396
Let's go to the time machine place.

487
00:38:46,397 --> 00:38:47,105
Okay!

488
00:39:08,127 --> 00:39:10,045
Ah! That's right...

489
00:39:10,088 --> 00:39:11,463
There he is!

490
00:39:11,506 --> 00:39:15,926
Geez, just make people
worry. He didn't fall asleep, right?

491
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,017
It is nothing.

492
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:25,310
Do not tell me...

493
00:39:25,311 --> 00:39:28,230
W-Wait! Where are you going?

494
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:29,231
Toilet!

495
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:31,191
Are you dying?

496
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:32,609
Don't talk stupid like that!

497
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:38,865
This isn't the one!

498
00:39:40,118 --> 00:39:41,159
Nothing! Nothing!

499
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,244
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

500
00:39:42,245 --> 00:39:43,870
Nothing! Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

501
00:39:45,081 --> 00:39:47,124
It's not anywhere!

502
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:48,542
What happened?

503
00:39:48,543 --> 00:39:51,128
The time machine was taken by someone!

504
00:39:51,921 --> 00:39:53,130
By whom?

505
00:39:53,131 --> 00:39:57,634
There is only one person who
can drive a time machine today.

506
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:02,514
Your adult self!

507
00:40:04,267 --> 00:40:07,936
Geez, haphazardly riding time machine.

508
00:40:07,937 --> 00:40:12,274
Did he go to another era?
Your adult self.

509
00:40:12,275 --> 00:40:14,109
But why?

510
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:17,529
I do not know? He is you!

511
00:40:17,530 --> 00:40:19,823
Don't you have any ideas?

512
00:40:19,907 --> 00:40:23,785
I do not know?
He's me from the future.

513
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:32,127
Ah... no him, not you.
Nobita is always like that.

514
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:33,420
Forgive me.

515
00:40:36,549 --> 00:40:37,924
What is wrong?

516
00:40:39,844 --> 00:40:43,472
So we can't go home from this era?

517
00:40:46,309 --> 00:40:50,562
This has happened before.
You can do something, right?

518
00:40:50,563 --> 00:40:55,609
Everything will be all right, right, Doraemon?
Oh yes! What about the Time Belt?

519
00:40:55,610 --> 00:40:57,569
I told you...

520
00:40:57,570 --> 00:40:59,821
Being tidied up.

521
00:40:59,822 --> 00:41:03,283
Everything that could help
us get home was left behind.

522
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:07,245
How about it, Doraemon?

523
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:11,958
Well, we have to live
in this era like this...

524
00:41:24,430 --> 00:41:26,932
am hungry.

525
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:30,769
Surely everyone has come
home from the party venue.

526
00:41:32,605 --> 00:41:35,524
Everything must be messy.

527
00:41:35,525 --> 00:41:40,237
Of the gadgets here, is there anything that
can be used to return home or not, huh?

528
00:41:46,869 --> 00:41:49,996
This is it! We can use this!

529
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:54,751
"Soul Time Machine"!

530
00:41:54,752 --> 00:41:57,003
"Soul Time Machine"?

531
00:41:57,004 --> 00:42:01,383
This gadget will absorb your soul
and send it to you in a different era.

532
00:42:01,384 --> 00:42:07,305
With this, we can send your
soul to the moment before we left.

533
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:10,076
At that time, the time
machine was still there, so you

534
00:42:10,088 --> 00:42:12,769
could use the time machine
and come back here, right?

535
00:42:14,397 --> 00:42:17,023
If you try it, you will understand.

536
00:42:26,158 --> 00:42:28,034
Please, yes, Nobita!

537
00:42:49,557 --> 00:42:55,187
Hey, if we do it one more time, don't
you the one who will be nagged by Mother?

538
00:42:55,188 --> 00:42:56,771
Don't talk carelessly!

539
00:43:04,947 --> 00:43:10,160
Nobita! Nobita! Nobita!

540
00:43:11,203 --> 00:43:12,829
Oh, so it's like this, huh?

541
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:14,122
Are you alright?

542
00:43:17,001 --> 00:43:18,335
It worked!

543
00:43:18,336 --> 00:43:21,046
Are you okay, Nobita?

544
00:43:21,047 --> 00:43:23,298
Yes I'm fine.

545
00:43:23,299 --> 00:43:27,052
I have to hurry and save both of us.

546
00:43:27,053 --> 00:43:29,763
Nobita? Nobita!

547
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:37,270
Is he all right?

548
00:43:39,398 --> 00:43:42,734
Looks like he's taking a nap.

549
00:43:42,735 --> 00:43:46,529
This is indeed hobby, hahaha.

550
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:51,451
Ah, what a mess.

551
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:55,538
Doraemon!

552
00:43:57,041 --> 00:43:58,458
Nobita!

553
00:43:58,542 --> 00:44:00,669
I got the time machine!

554
00:44:08,177 --> 00:44:10,136
Then, let's return it to normal, OK.

555
00:44:10,137 --> 00:44:10,845
Okay.

556
00:44:18,938 --> 00:44:20,730
It worked!

557
00:44:20,731 --> 00:44:23,817
Eh? Me why?

558
00:44:23,818 --> 00:44:26,236
I have two?

559
00:44:26,237 --> 00:44:29,030
This is the future, right?

560
00:44:29,031 --> 00:44:31,700
Stop it. Do not worry about it.

561
00:44:31,701 --> 00:44:33,535
What is it?

562
00:44:33,536 --> 00:44:35,537
Alright, really.

563
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:40,834
Hey, why am I suddenly in the future?

564
00:44:40,835 --> 00:44:43,795
Why there are two me?

565
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:46,172
Do not worry about it.

566
00:44:46,173 --> 00:44:49,509
How could that be? Please explain!

567
00:44:54,724 --> 00:44:59,144
Before it got complicated, we
made this Nobita forget about it.

568
00:44:59,145 --> 00:45:01,521
This forgetful stick is useful too, huh.

569
00:45:01,522 --> 00:45:05,275
Eh? Why am I here?

570
00:45:05,276 --> 00:45:07,902
No, don't think about it.

571
00:45:12,491 --> 00:45:16,494
Duh, where is he?

572
00:45:17,496 --> 00:45:24,210
Hah? Me why?
They took me there on a time machine.

573
00:45:24,211 --> 00:45:25,587
Who?

574
00:45:26,380 --> 00:45:28,923
This way, we can rest easy.

575
00:45:28,924 --> 00:45:30,884
Oh, no!

576
00:45:30,885 --> 00:45:34,387
Nobita, go shopping for a bit!

577
00:45:34,388 --> 00:45:35,680
It's Mother!

578
00:45:36,724 --> 00:45:39,184
Hurry up and hide here!

579
00:45:44,523 --> 00:45:47,859
Just recently, mom said too much.

580
00:45:49,779 --> 00:45:51,863
If you're there, please answer...

581
00:45:53,657 --> 00:45:59,871
Well, now... where is
the adult Nobita, huh?

582
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:15,220
What does it mean?

583
00:46:15,221 --> 00:46:20,058
Nobita who has grown
up may exist in this era.

584
00:46:55,052 --> 00:46:58,054
I have no reason to meet you guys.

585
00:46:58,055 --> 00:47:02,016
Especially after I said
that half a year ago.

586
00:47:02,351 --> 00:47:04,602
Do you want to meet Doraemon?

587
00:47:04,603 --> 00:47:06,813
No, I don't have to.

588
00:47:06,814 --> 00:47:12,485
Doraemon is your friend...
my friend when I was little.

589
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:16,698
Oh yes!

590
00:47:16,699 --> 00:47:18,533
What's wrong?

591
00:47:18,534 --> 00:47:21,995
By the way, why did you
run away from the wedding?

592
00:47:21,996 --> 00:47:24,414
Don't you like Shizuka anymore?

593
00:47:24,415 --> 00:47:27,750
How could that be!
I like her! I really love her!

594
00:47:27,751 --> 00:47:32,005
Being able to marry
Shizuka is truly a dream.

595
00:47:32,006 --> 00:47:33,381
But?

596
00:47:33,465 --> 00:47:36,718
But what?

597
00:47:36,719 --> 00:47:40,354
Yesterday, after
drinking with friends and I

598
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:43,850
was alone, I was
thinking about the future.

599
00:47:44,727 --> 00:47:51,524
Then, I got scared
Afraid... Afraid... So scared!

600
00:47:51,525 --> 00:47:52,734
Afraid of what?

601
00:47:53,194 --> 00:47:58,990
Since I'm like this, maybe I
can't make Shizuka happy!

602
00:47:58,991 --> 00:48:01,242
Why are you so weak?

603
00:48:01,243 --> 00:48:06,372
After all, you also know why
Shizuka wanted to marry me, right?

604
00:48:06,373 --> 00:48:10,043
She felt that I was unreliable.

605
00:48:10,377 --> 00:48:15,423
Nobita has not changed at all, huh.

606
00:48:15,424 --> 00:48:20,428
If we let it go, we don't know
what will happen, I get worried.

607
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,015
1 understand.

608
00:48:24,433 --> 00:48:30,897
If she married me for a reason
like that, pity Shizuka herself!

609
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:35,693
She's too kind.

610
00:48:35,694 --> 00:48:38,404
So that's why you came back to this time?

611
00:48:38,405 --> 00:48:42,116
At that time, I happened
to go to a public toilet.

612
00:48:51,627 --> 00:48:54,045
Why is there a time machine here?

613
00:48:55,256 --> 00:49:01,177
I don't care where the machine
takes me. I just want time to think.

614
00:49:01,178 --> 00:49:04,190
The reason I return
to this time is because

615
00:49:04,202 --> 00:49:07,433
the time machine is
set to return to this time.

616
00:49:07,434 --> 00:49:10,144
So that's the reason you left the wedding?

617
00:49:10,145 --> 00:49:14,315
Don't you think you've
been a bother for everyone?

618
00:49:14,316 --> 00:49:20,071
Don’t worry. When I got more confident, I
would go back to my wedding party, really.

619
00:49:20,072 --> 00:49:21,906
If that's the case, I also know...

620
00:49:23,117 --> 00:49:25,118
Could it be, have you seen it?

621
00:49:25,911 --> 00:49:27,245
I'm not coming back?

622
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:29,205
That's why we are looking for you.

623
00:49:30,291 --> 00:49:32,292
What happened?

624
00:49:32,293 --> 00:49:33,793
1 don't know!

625
00:49:33,836 --> 00:49:37,297
When the wedding started, you were gone!

626
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:38,631
Then the wedding?

627
00:49:38,632 --> 00:49:41,259
I replaced you.

628
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:43,678
But in the middle I also ran away.

629
00:49:43,679 --> 00:49:45,847
The marriage must have gone awry.

630
00:49:46,974 --> 00:49:48,683
What are you doing?

631
00:49:48,684 --> 00:49:49,851
But why?

632
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,353
Suddenly I didn't feel confident, you know.

633
00:49:54,231 --> 00:49:56,232
So sad?

634
00:49:56,233 --> 00:50:00,111
Didn't you come back
because of an accident?

635
00:50:01,613 --> 00:50:05,283
Then what, then?

636
00:50:07,786 --> 00:50:09,746
What kind of accident?!

637
00:50:22,718 --> 00:50:25,636
Can't you forget Nobita?

638
00:50:28,223 --> 00:50:31,225
I don't know why he disappeared suddenly.

639
00:50:31,226 --> 00:50:33,519
Even though he said he liked me.

640
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:38,691
Seriously, Nobita. If I find
him, I'll beat him black and blue.

641
00:50:38,692 --> 00:50:43,237
But I believe, Nobita
will definitely come back.

642
00:50:43,238 --> 00:50:49,077
And when he comes back, he'll
tell me everything. I believe it.

643
00:50:49,161 --> 00:50:57,794
I'm sorry, Shizuka! But
understand! I'm doing this for you too!

644
00:50:57,795 --> 00:51:00,922
Take out your courage and come back.

645
00:51:00,923 --> 00:51:04,550
I can not. If time has
passed any minute,...

646
00:51:04,551 --> 00:51:10,723
...surely Shizuka would forget
me and meet another man.

647
00:51:10,724 --> 00:51:15,520
If she forgets me, she can be happy.

648
00:51:15,521 --> 00:51:19,065
Then, do you want to
see Shizuka's future again?

649
00:51:19,066 --> 00:51:28,741
No. I don't want to see
Shizuka happy with another man!

650
00:51:28,742 --> 00:51:31,035
How selfish.

651
00:51:31,036 --> 00:51:38,042
But if she turns out to be unhappy,
I don't want to look anymore!

652
00:51:38,043 --> 00:51:39,919
How troublesome this guy is.

653
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:42,630
He's you after all.

654
00:51:42,715 --> 00:51:46,590
Come to think of it, this is
all because you are usually

655
00:51:46,602 --> 00:51:50,012
just taking naps, which
is why I became like this.

656
00:51:50,013 --> 00:51:53,933
Homework is not even
done, and tests can be 0 only.

657
00:51:53,934 --> 00:51:55,601
Have no confidence anymore.

658
00:51:55,602 --> 00:51:57,937
Don't blame me, please!

659
00:51:57,938 --> 00:52:01,023
Don't fight with yourself!

660
00:52:02,109 --> 00:52:07,196
Ah, if I could go back to this
time, maybe I could fix things up.

661
00:52:07,197 --> 00:52:09,240
If you want, it's easy, really.

662
00:52:11,910 --> 00:52:14,203
"Soul Swapping Ropes"!

663
00:52:14,204 --> 00:52:19,500
If you hold this rope,
you can change bodies.

664
00:52:30,721 --> 00:52:33,014
Why are you so excited?
It's Dangerous, you know.

665
00:52:33,015 --> 00:52:37,185
Besides, when are you coming
back? Just now you still weren't around.

666
00:52:37,186 --> 00:52:41,147
Now, how happy. This feeling and that...

667
00:52:42,024 --> 00:52:43,274
No, nothing.

668
00:52:43,317 --> 00:52:44,734
I'll play first, OK!

669
00:52:44,735 --> 00:52:46,402
Ah, Nobita, the shopping...

670
00:52:48,947 --> 00:52:51,240
It was out suddenly.

671
00:52:57,915 --> 00:53:02,335
Wow, Gian and the others are still kids.

672
00:53:02,336 --> 00:53:05,004
Of course, hahaha.

673
00:53:05,672 --> 00:53:07,799
Hey, how are you?

674
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,343
What are you doing, Nobita? Very arrogant.

675
00:53:10,344 --> 00:53:13,304
Even though you are Nobita,
you really don't hesitate!

676
00:53:13,305 --> 00:53:15,056
I also want to play, please.

677
00:53:15,057 --> 00:53:19,644
Oh, it's the first time you
asked to enter yourself.

678
00:53:19,645 --> 00:53:20,978
Okay, let's try it.

679
00:53:21,063 --> 00:53:24,357
You want to play baseball yourself.

680
00:53:24,358 --> 00:53:28,069
He must have been training hard and finally
become an expert at playing baseball.

681
00:53:33,158 --> 00:53:35,451
Catch it fast!

682
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:39,705
Nobita, you understand, right?

683
00:53:43,502 --> 00:53:45,253
Batter, out!

684
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:56,264
Even though he is an adult,
he still hasn't changed at all.

685
00:53:56,265 --> 00:53:58,099
That's right, yes.

686
00:54:02,145 --> 00:54:07,149
Nobita! What does this mean?

687
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:13,197
You asked yourself to come
in, why did it turn out like this?

688
00:54:13,198 --> 00:54:16,033
Oh right, you're angry.
Of course you get angry.

689
00:54:16,118 --> 00:54:19,245
What did you say?

690
00:54:19,246 --> 00:54:22,832
We lost because of you, you know!

691
00:54:23,834 --> 00:54:26,878
His sense of power
simply couldn't stand it.

692
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:29,130
Damn it!

693
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:30,882
No kidding!

694
00:54:32,384 --> 00:54:34,760
This is it! This feeling!

695
00:54:34,761 --> 00:54:39,515
He looks so happy. Adults
just can't be understood.

696
00:54:42,019 --> 00:54:46,772
Well, if he's tired, he can
also go home by himself.

697
00:54:47,774 --> 00:54:53,279
Nobita, with a body like that,
we better enter from the window.

698
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:55,865
Yes, that’s right.

699
00:55:06,043 --> 00:55:10,421
Hey, finally you guys came
home. Where have you been?

700
00:55:10,881 --> 00:55:11,714
Who are you?

701
00:55:11,715 --> 00:55:18,012
Oh, sorry. I'm from the future
department store. My name is Nakameguro.

702
00:55:18,013 --> 00:55:21,932
Oh, those of you who
like to give us samples.

703
00:55:21,933 --> 00:55:23,559
Why are you here today?

704
00:55:23,560 --> 00:55:30,107
Um, about the soul-swaping
rope I sent here...

705
00:55:30,108 --> 00:55:31,943
I want to take it back.

706
00:55:31,944 --> 00:55:34,695
Hah? Is there any problem?

707
00:55:34,696 --> 00:55:36,197
Of course not!

708
00:55:36,198 --> 00:55:40,660
That's the gadgets that we choose
carefully from the shop right away...

709
00:55:40,661 --> 00:55:43,204
How could there be a problem...

710
00:55:44,414 --> 00:55:47,208
Then why?

711
00:55:47,209 --> 00:55:50,836
Um, that... about that..

712
00:55:50,837 --> 00:55:54,048
Don’t worry. We'll
definitely return it, really.

713
00:55:54,049 --> 00:55:56,592
Oh, thank you very much!

714
00:55:56,593 --> 00:55:58,719
But wait a minute, okay.

715
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:03,140
We just used the rope for Nobita. If they
have exchanged it back, we will return it.

716
00:56:03,141 --> 00:56:05,476
I'm actually a kid.

717
00:56:07,229 --> 00:56:08,521
So what?

718
00:56:08,522 --> 00:56:12,608
H-H-H-How long has it been
since you guys used that rope?

719
00:56:12,609 --> 00:56:15,569
Hmm... how many minutes has it been?

720
00:56:15,779 --> 00:56:19,407
Almost 1 hour, right?

721
00:56:19,491 --> 00:56:21,867
W-W-W-W-W-W-W-What!

722
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:22,576
Hah?

723
00:56:22,577 --> 00:56:24,662
This is bad!

724
00:56:24,663 --> 00:56:27,206
Listen carefully.

725
00:56:27,207 --> 00:56:32,628
Actually, the gadget has
a slight error in its design...

726
00:56:34,631 --> 00:56:38,217
After 1 hour, their
consciousness will disappear?

727
00:56:38,218 --> 00:56:40,761
And the memories of both of us...

728
00:56:40,762 --> 00:56:43,929
If you don't quickly
return to your original

729
00:56:43,941 --> 00:56:46,767
self, the memories
will be lost forever.

730
00:56:46,768 --> 00:56:47,977
Nobita!

731
00:56:47,978 --> 00:56:49,145
Come on, quickly!

732
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:54,650
W-Where are .you going?

733
00:56:54,651 --> 00:56:57,278
First of all we ask this gadget.

734
00:56:57,320 --> 00:57:00,322
Where is the adult Nobita?

735
00:57:04,703 --> 00:57:06,787
Why can't it?

736
00:57:06,788 --> 00:57:10,458
What can I do, we just
search from here first.

737
00:57:15,756 --> 00:57:17,423
Why? What is wrong?

738
00:57:17,424 --> 00:57:21,844
Could it be... Nobita who has grown
up was not returning to the future..

739
00:57:21,845 --> 00:57:24,055
Because he couldn't
go back to the future.,

740
00:57:24,473 --> 00:57:25,556
What do you mean?

741
00:57:25,557 --> 00:57:29,643
If he has lost his memory,
he doesn't know himself, right?

742
00:57:31,688 --> 00:57:37,193
Then, my memories in this
era will also be lost, right?

743
00:57:37,194 --> 00:57:41,197
It's a shame, but there you have it.

744
00:57:41,198 --> 00:57:44,492
I don't want that!

745
00:57:44,493 --> 00:57:46,911
Nobita, wait a minute!

746
00:57:56,421 --> 00:58:01,300
Finally I am free from them,
and Suneo are so stubborn.

747
00:58:01,301 --> 00:58:03,010
Excuse me.

748
00:58:04,596 --> 00:58:08,182
Hey. Excuse me, you said?

749
00:58:08,183 --> 00:58:12,895
Why are you angry?
It was just a little hit.

750
00:58:12,896 --> 00:58:18,442
What's with this kid?
Why are you so arrogant?

751
00:58:18,443 --> 00:58:20,986
Stop it, all of you.

752
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:25,533
He told us to stop...

753
00:58:26,993 --> 00:58:28,786
You don't know, do you?

754
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:35,501
Oye, don't you have any
sense of apologies at all?

755
00:58:35,502 --> 00:58:36,627
Y-yes.

756
00:58:36,628 --> 00:58:41,340
What? Do you know what
usually happens at times like this?

757
00:58:41,341 --> 00:58:42,716
N-No.

758
00:58:42,717 --> 00:58:47,471
Don't know? Then I'll tell you.

759
00:58:47,472 --> 00:58:49,515
Listen carefully, you know.

760
00:58:51,142 --> 00:58:55,312
What about compensation money?

761
00:58:55,313 --> 00:58:58,232
Compensation? How much?

762
00:58:58,233 --> 00:58:59,942
Yes, 1000 yen.

763
00:58:59,943 --> 00:59:04,280
Wait, because you are
arrogant, how about 2000 yen?

764
00:59:04,281 --> 00:59:11,162
But this is not coercion, you
know. This is just a suggestion.

765
00:59:11,955 --> 00:59:15,708
Hahaha, you junior high school student.

766
00:59:15,709 --> 00:59:19,420
If that's all I can pay happily.

767
00:59:19,421 --> 00:59:24,300
I always carry paper
money for times like this.

768
00:59:24,467 --> 00:59:26,552
Take this.

769
00:59:27,053 --> 00:59:32,182
Hah? Why is this money
has picture of Osamu Tezuka?

770
00:59:32,183 --> 00:59:36,061
Alas, this is money from the future.

771
00:59:36,062 --> 00:59:38,272
Did you take this money
from the children's bank?

772
00:59:38,273 --> 00:59:41,567
Oye, don't mess around. Bring
out the real thing! Take it out!

773
00:59:41,568 --> 00:59:44,111
Come on, get out the real money!

774
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:56,790
I can drive this vehicle, you know,
because I'm actually an adult.

775
00:59:58,293 --> 01:00:00,044
Go, scooter!

776
01:00:03,673 --> 01:00:05,633
Okay, scooter!

777
01:00:05,634 --> 01:00:07,009
Hey, scooter!

778
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:14,725
In this era there is no
control of the sound, huh?

779
01:00:15,685 --> 01:00:20,397
Then, how about we start the punishment?

780
01:00:20,398 --> 01:00:21,690
Stupid brat...

781
01:00:28,406 --> 01:00:31,200
My scooter!

782
01:00:31,201 --> 01:00:33,619
Forgive me!

783
01:00:33,620 --> 01:00:35,371
Dammit.

784
01:00:38,124 --> 01:00:39,541
Hah?

785
01:00:55,684 --> 01:00:57,559
Excuse me!

786
01:01:12,117 --> 01:01:14,618
Forgive me!

787
01:01:26,131 --> 01:01:27,381
Shizuka?

788
01:01:45,984 --> 01:01:48,152
Hey, you...

789
01:01:53,241 --> 01:01:55,743
Yes, you are interesting too.

790
01:01:58,997 --> 01:02:04,626
Wait a minute. Come to think
of it, this is your fault, right?

791
01:02:06,379 --> 01:02:10,507
You're just junior high school kids.
You can't do like this.

792
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:13,886
How can you threaten
adult who is older than you.

793
01:02:15,305 --> 01:02:18,974
How could you be...

794
01:02:25,148 --> 01:02:28,233
How could you avoid it!

795
01:02:28,234 --> 01:02:31,153
Eh? Why just now?

796
01:02:31,613 --> 01:02:36,408
How dare you. I can't forgive!

797
01:02:37,535 --> 01:02:39,286
Take this!

798
01:02:41,581 --> 01:02:45,793
It hurts... It's scary...

799
01:02:45,794 --> 01:02:50,839
Geez.
Where is the adult Nobita?

800
01:02:53,301 --> 01:02:55,010
Nobita!

801
01:03:06,106 --> 01:03:07,314
Nobita!

802
01:03:08,108 --> 01:03:10,067
Nobita!

803
01:03:23,206 --> 01:03:25,874
It's very dangerous. Let's go down first.

804
01:03:29,254 --> 01:03:31,713
Nobita, are you okay?

805
01:03:34,843 --> 01:03:37,845
Who are you?

806
01:03:37,846 --> 01:03:42,224
It's me, Doraemon! Just hold on!

807
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:49,106
That is true. I'm just stunned a little...

808
01:03:49,107 --> 01:03:51,316
Your consciousness starts to
lose little by little! Nobita, hang on!

809
01:03:51,317 --> 01:03:53,610
Hang in there, Nobita!

810
01:03:55,697 --> 01:03:57,322
Don’t worry.

811
01:04:00,618 --> 01:04:02,870
I will definitely restore
my future with Shizuka.

812
01:04:03,830 --> 01:04:04,830
Nobita...

813
01:04:09,711 --> 01:04:12,004
We don't have time. Come on, quickly!

814
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:15,507
You guys calm down, please.

815
01:04:15,508 --> 01:04:20,012
It's your nature that makes us nervous!

816
01:04:20,013 --> 01:04:22,139
Stop bothering weak people.

817
01:04:23,766 --> 01:04:26,393
Who are you?

818
01:04:26,394 --> 01:04:29,521
The kids in this town are all so arrogant.

819
01:04:30,732 --> 01:04:34,026
If you don't step aside
it can be dangerous.

820
01:04:34,027 --> 01:04:35,861
Shizuka, run away!

821
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,372
Why?

822
01:04:47,373 --> 01:04:49,625
Get away from Shizuka!

823
01:04:49,626 --> 01:04:51,126
Nobita!

824
01:04:53,254 --> 01:04:55,214
You are!

825
01:04:59,177 --> 01:05:00,928
Hah? Again, again...

826
01:05:02,388 --> 01:05:03,931
My head is dizzy...

827
01:05:03,932 --> 01:05:06,016
It felt like he was so hard to hit!

828
01:05:06,017 --> 01:05:09,144
That's not the case...

829
01:05:09,145 --> 01:05:11,313
You can't run away!

830
01:05:14,901 --> 01:05:15,526
Gian?

831
01:05:16,236 --> 01:05:19,696
So you ran off here, didn't you, Nobita?

832
01:05:19,697 --> 01:05:21,490
You!

833
01:05:32,669 --> 01:05:35,671
If this toy is damaged, you
have to compensate, you know.

834
01:05:35,672 --> 01:05:37,172
Suneo!

835
01:05:38,633 --> 01:05:40,634
Who are you?

836
01:05:42,011 --> 01:05:48,058
The only ones allowed to
beat Nobita are us, you know!

837
01:05:56,234 --> 01:05:57,943
Just remember, yes!

838
01:06:04,325 --> 01:06:06,243
You're great too, Nobita.

839
01:06:07,203 --> 01:06:11,957
You are so sloppy, huh.
Even though you can't fight.

840
01:06:12,917 --> 01:06:17,462
Did 1 protect Shizuka?

841
01:06:19,924 --> 01:06:22,134
Hooray!

842
01:06:28,349 --> 01:06:31,435
Nobita? Why? Just hold on!

843
01:06:31,436 --> 01:06:34,021
Nobita got on a scooter earlier and fell.

844
01:06:34,022 --> 01:06:34,813
What?

845
01:06:34,814 --> 01:06:36,606
Maybe he hit his head.

846
01:06:36,607 --> 01:06:41,612
Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad!

847
01:06:42,822 --> 01:06:45,324
Hang in there, Nobita!

848
01:06:46,034 --> 01:06:48,035
Don’t worry.

849
01:06:48,036 --> 01:06:52,205
We will surely find my adult myself.

850
01:06:52,206 --> 01:07:00,213
I will protect my future with Shizuka...

851
01:07:00,214 --> 01:07:03,091
Nobita! Ah, Nobita!

852
01:07:03,092 --> 01:07:07,596
How about this? At this rate,
Nobita will lose his memory!

853
01:07:07,597 --> 01:07:10,015
Where is the adult Nobita? Damnit!

854
01:07:11,893 --> 01:07:17,105
How about this? Is there
no gadget that can be used?

855
01:07:17,106 --> 01:07:18,273
Oh yes! There is this!

856
01:07:20,026 --> 01:07:22,235
Go to where adult Nobita is!

857
01:07:24,906 --> 01:07:29,451
He's not an adult Nobita currently...

858
01:07:29,452 --> 01:07:35,707
Ah, what should I do? What should I do?

859
01:07:36,542 --> 01:07:38,126
Wait a minute.

860
01:07:38,127 --> 01:07:41,671
If I say more carefully, will it work?

861
01:07:42,840 --> 01:07:47,511
Go to little Nobita's place
where there is an adult Nobita!

862
01:07:55,770 --> 01:07:58,105
Nobita! Nobita!

863
01:07:58,106 --> 01:08:00,399
Oye, hang on, Nobita!

864
01:08:00,400 --> 01:08:02,859
We've called an ambulance!

865
01:08:03,611 --> 01:08:05,112
Hooray, it worked!

866
01:08:08,991 --> 01:08:10,951
Who is it?

867
01:08:10,952 --> 01:08:14,705
Do not ask.
Just put this rope on that Nobita.

868
01:08:14,706 --> 01:08:15,706
Okay!

869
01:08:18,418 --> 01:08:20,252
He can't go back.

870
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,172
What happened?

871
01:08:24,173 --> 01:08:27,801
Just try it first!
Don't say you can't!

872
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:30,429
But the mechanism was set up like this...

873
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:35,683
I said try it first! If Nobita doesn't
come back, I'll crush you to pieces!

874
01:08:35,684 --> 01:08:37,185
Even if you say so...

875
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:42,149
Do not give up!
If we don't try it, we won't know, right?

876
01:08:42,150 --> 01:08:45,944
A-Alright. Geez, using the
rope is very rough, though.

877
01:08:48,990 --> 01:08:53,034
See. The time has been
too long, so he can't go back.

878
01:08:53,035 --> 01:08:54,035
Shut up!

879
01:08:54,996 --> 01:08:56,329
Hold on...

880
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:02,460
I can't do it...

881
01:09:03,171 --> 01:09:05,046
What happened?

882
01:09:05,047 --> 01:09:08,424
Nobita, do you want this?

883
01:09:08,425 --> 01:09:13,013
Your memories of Gian, Suneo,
and Shizuka will be lost, you know.

884
01:09:13,014 --> 01:09:15,307
Really? You're kidding, right?

885
01:09:15,308 --> 01:09:16,475
You're kidding, right?

886
01:09:17,101 --> 01:09:21,855
Nobita, you will forget me too.

887
01:09:21,856 --> 01:09:24,775
Do you want that?

888
01:09:38,372 --> 01:09:41,875
I do not want!

889
01:10:00,436 --> 01:10:02,562
Oh, It's moving!

890
01:10:03,940 --> 01:10:05,524
We made it in time.

891
01:10:06,818 --> 01:10:08,109
Nobita!

892
01:10:46,899 --> 01:10:49,568
Nobita! Nobita!

893
01:10:52,405 --> 01:10:54,155
Shizuka?

894
01:10:56,617 --> 01:10:59,744
Geez! Nobita, you idiot!

895
01:10:59,829 --> 01:11:03,248
Why are you fighting,
even though you can't?

896
01:11:03,249 --> 01:11:05,333
Don't force it.

897
01:11:05,334 --> 01:11:08,753
Let it be what you are!

898
01:11:23,144 --> 01:11:25,228
Are you alright?

899
01:11:25,229 --> 01:11:29,399
Yes. I think I can go home.

900
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:32,027
Yes. Looks like I've been able
to go back to my Shizuka's place.

901
01:11:36,824 --> 01:11:41,161
But before returning to the future,
there is one place I want to visit.

902
01:11:41,162 --> 01:11:46,791
Because I have to make a
speech at the wedding, right?

903
01:11:46,792 --> 01:11:48,084
Could it be, you want to go to...

904
01:11:48,085 --> 01:11:49,669
Yes, our

905
01:11:49,670 --> 01:11:51,129
Yes, our birthday!

906
01:11:51,130 --> 01:11:57,010
That's right. I also want to make sure that
I really am the child of this family,...

907
01:11:57,011 --> 01:11:59,596
...and why they gave me the name Nobita.

908
01:11:59,597 --> 01:12:01,556
I also want to know.

909
01:12:01,557 --> 01:12:05,936
Okay, okay. It's been this
far, I just follow your wishes.

910
01:12:16,530 --> 01:12:19,658
Wow, this was my house 10 years ago!

911
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:24,245
At that time, this room
was still Father's room.

912
01:12:24,246 --> 01:12:27,165
Looks like we've stolen her hobby room.

913
01:12:27,166 --> 01:12:30,543
There are no blisters on the pillars yet.

914
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:33,421
But there's nobody here.

915
01:12:33,422 --> 01:12:36,883
If my parents are not here, how am I born?

916
01:12:36,884 --> 01:12:40,387
Could it be that you are
really an adopted child?

917
01:12:40,388 --> 01:12:43,348
See. That is right!

918
01:12:43,349 --> 01:12:46,142
Calm down, they must be in the hospital.

919
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:48,436
Where is she? Where is she?

920
01:12:48,437 --> 01:12:51,690
Oh, Dad! 10 years younger!

921
01:12:51,691 --> 01:12:54,442
From my point of view,
he's 25 years younger!

922
01:12:55,695 --> 01:12:57,570
Still like a young man.

923
01:12:57,571 --> 01:13:00,365
Who are you?

924
01:13:00,449 --> 01:13:02,742
You forgot your own son!

925
01:13:02,743 --> 01:13:06,329
Do not say like that!
You weren't born here!

926
01:13:06,330 --> 01:13:10,834
Excuse me, it looks like
we are at the wrong house.

927
01:13:13,337 --> 01:13:15,130
What is that?

928
01:13:15,131 --> 01:13:19,342
Instead of thinking about
that, where is the baby, huh?

929
01:13:19,343 --> 01:13:23,013
Even though I was home early from work.

930
01:13:24,223 --> 01:13:27,600
Ah, where? Where? Here, huh?

931
01:13:29,228 --> 01:13:31,229
Isn't he at the hospital?

932
01:13:31,230 --> 01:13:33,022
Oh yes! That is true!

933
01:13:35,526 --> 01:13:37,527
In such a hurry.

934
01:13:38,320 --> 01:13:40,864
By the way, where is the hospital?

935
01:13:40,865 --> 01:13:44,534
Wait a minute! We're coming too!

936
01:13:49,206 --> 01:13:52,959
Congratulations, sir! Your son is born.

937
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:54,753
Oh, thanks for the food!

938
01:13:54,754 --> 01:13:57,255
No, I mean... thank you.

939
01:13:57,256 --> 01:13:58,423
Come here.

940
01:13:58,424 --> 01:14:01,801
Huh, I'm so excited.

941
01:14:01,802 --> 01:14:06,181
I'm excited too.
What type of baby that be?

942
01:14:06,182 --> 01:14:09,768
Must be a cute kid like us.

943
01:14:09,769 --> 01:14:13,897
Hahaha, it's better not
to get your hopes up.

944
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:16,858
Tama-Chan!

945
01:14:19,528 --> 01:14:22,906
Hello, this is Dad, son!

946
01:14:23,783 --> 01:14:27,911
How cute he's. This is my son, right?

947
01:14:27,912 --> 01:14:30,413
Hello, my baby!

948
01:14:30,414 --> 01:14:33,249
1 want to see too!

949
01:14:34,001 --> 01:14:35,668
Is this me?

950
01:14:35,669 --> 01:14:38,630
Why are there wrinkles like
this? Looks like a monkey!

951
01:14:39,673 --> 01:14:42,383
What do you mean monkey, huh?

952
01:14:44,929 --> 01:14:48,139
That was shocking. Don't be that angry too.

953
01:14:48,140 --> 01:14:50,391
He's mad because you
weren't being polite, right?

954
01:14:50,392 --> 01:14:53,686
After all, isn't baby Nobita cute?

955
01:14:53,687 --> 01:14:59,234
No! Not cute at all!
Surely that baby is not me!

956
01:14:59,235 --> 01:15:02,195
Newborn babies are like that, you know.

957
01:15:02,196 --> 01:15:04,531
Who are those kids?

958
01:15:04,532 --> 01:15:06,950
They've been following me from earlier.

959
01:15:06,951 --> 01:15:09,744
I wonder what their parents look like.

960
01:15:11,122 --> 01:15:14,499
Where's my mom, by the way?
She should be with you, right?

961
01:15:14,500 --> 01:15:17,836
Oh, she said she wanted
to tell our ancestors.

962
01:15:17,837 --> 01:15:19,629
She must be very happy, huh?

963
01:15:19,630 --> 01:15:23,508
Yes, she couldn't stop crying.

964
01:15:24,510 --> 01:15:26,344
This bear?

965
01:15:26,345 --> 01:15:28,721
Mother's gift for this child.

966
01:15:29,849 --> 01:15:31,724
Too fast, right?

967
01:15:37,314 --> 01:15:41,401
By the way, what about this child's name?

968
01:15:41,402 --> 01:15:43,486
I thought about it carefully.

969
01:15:43,487 --> 01:15:45,572
What is that?

970
01:15:45,573 --> 01:15:48,867
Tadaaa, I'm telling you, yes.

971
01:15:48,868 --> 01:15:51,119
Nobita Nobi!

972
01:15:52,121 --> 01:15:53,830
Nobita?

973
01:15:53,831 --> 01:15:55,456
Nice name, right?

974
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:58,918
I want a cooler name.

975
01:15:58,919 --> 01:16:01,296
They should listen to our hopes, please.

976
01:16:01,297 --> 01:16:04,257
Stop it, stop it. You'll be
scolded again, you know!

977
01:16:04,258 --> 01:16:07,635
The meaning of the
name? Of course there is!

978
01:16:07,636 --> 01:16:13,725
I want this child to
grow up healthy always.

979
01:16:13,726 --> 01:16:15,768
What a nice name.

980
01:16:16,645 --> 01:16:18,438
Nobita Nobi.

981
01:16:21,192 --> 01:16:22,525
I like that name.

982
01:16:23,777 --> 01:16:27,113
So they thought about the name carefully.

983
01:16:30,284 --> 01:16:33,328
I want to raise him to be a good boy.

984
01:16:34,413 --> 01:16:37,040
He must be a good boy!

985
01:16:37,041 --> 01:16:41,044
If he looks like you,
he will be doing well.

986
01:16:41,045 --> 01:16:45,548
If he looks like you, he
will be good at sports.

987
01:16:45,549 --> 01:16:46,424
Truly.

988
01:16:46,425 --> 01:16:49,636
You only looks alike in the
weak spots of your parents.

989
01:16:49,637 --> 01:16:51,220
What a chatterbox, ah!

990
01:16:51,931 --> 01:16:56,434
Is he going to be a professor?
Or a baseball player?

991
01:16:56,435 --> 01:16:57,977
He can be a painter too.

992
01:16:59,605 --> 01:17:02,357
Painter, sculptor, musician.

993
01:17:02,358 --> 01:17:03,691
Anything is okay.

994
01:17:03,692 --> 01:17:06,945
As long as he is of
use to those around him.

995
01:17:06,946 --> 01:17:09,948
Care for others and be brave.

996
01:17:09,949 --> 01:17:14,744
A cheerful child, a real boy,
strong, fair, and handsome.

997
01:17:16,705 --> 01:17:21,000
Um, don't get your hopes up, anyway.

998
01:17:21,001 --> 01:17:23,670
He's not that great kid, really.

999
01:17:23,671 --> 01:17:28,508
From earlier you kept bothering me.
Do you have a grudge against my son?!

1000
01:17:35,015 --> 01:17:36,849
Father and mother

1001
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:38,810
They are very happy.

1002
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:41,729
They are full of hope.

1003
01:17:47,611 --> 01:17:50,113
Let's go back to the future.

1004
01:18:06,046 --> 01:18:08,131
Finally we are back.

1005
01:18:14,388 --> 01:18:16,431
Oh, come here.

1006
01:18:16,432 --> 01:18:17,181
What? What?

1007
01:18:17,224 --> 01:18:18,182
Why?

1008
01:18:19,935 --> 01:18:21,227
Look at that.

1009
01:18:22,271 --> 01:18:27,233
In a place like that, greeting
means thanking your parents.

1010
01:18:27,234 --> 01:18:33,322
Be thankful? They always get
mad when I get 0 points! I can not!

1011
01:18:34,324 --> 01:18:36,534
You're still thinking about it.

1012
01:18:36,535 --> 01:18:38,786
To run like that...

1013
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:43,332
Come on, quickly.

1014
01:18:43,333 --> 01:18:48,921
Um... sorry, yeah. But can you go alone?

1015
01:18:49,798 --> 01:18:53,926
We still have important
promise that we must keep.

1016
01:18:53,927 --> 01:18:55,636
Right, Doraemon?

1017
01:18:56,805 --> 01:19:01,017
Oh, I see?
If so, this is goodbye.

1018
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:07,982
Thank you for finding me.

1019
01:19:07,983 --> 01:19:09,942
Thank you for finding me.:

1020
01:19:09,943 --> 01:19:13,863
Your future is mine too.:

1021
01:19:13,947 --> 01:19:17,408
Oh yes! This.

1022
01:19:21,705 --> 01:19:22,705
This...

1023
01:19:24,708 --> 01:19:25,541
See you later, yes!

1024
01:19:28,837 --> 01:19:31,714
By the way, what is that important promise?

1025
01:19:50,526 --> 01:19:53,444
Thanks for waiting!

1026
01:19:56,031 --> 01:19:58,825
Thank you!

1027
01:20:00,577 --> 01:20:06,916
Everyone, my healthy
friend, Nobita, is back!

1028
01:20:06,917 --> 01:20:10,086
Thank goodness, we survived.

1029
01:20:10,087 --> 01:20:11,671
Thank you, Nobita!

1030
01:20:12,881 --> 01:20:14,799
Really grateful!

1031
01:20:15,634 --> 01:20:17,426
But it took him a long time to come back.

1032
01:20:19,012 --> 01:20:21,097
I've bought time for you, you know.

1033
01:20:34,111 --> 01:20:35,820
Welcome back.

1034
01:20:36,613 --> 01:20:39,407
I am back.
You must be worried, right?

1035
01:20:39,408 --> 01:20:40,950
Not really.

1036
01:20:40,951 --> 01:20:43,744
Not at all.

1037
01:20:44,955 --> 01:20:51,586
Then, let us hear the Greeting
remarks from our groom once again.

1038
01:20:52,713 --> 01:20:54,046
The rain has stopped.

1039
01:21:10,189 --> 01:21:13,482
Everyone, good afternoon. I am Nobita Nobi.

1040
01:21:13,483 --> 01:21:15,276
We know already!

1041
01:21:17,321 --> 01:21:20,990
At first, I didn't like this name.

1042
01:21:21,700 --> 01:21:23,784
Because it seems slow and stupid.

1043
01:21:24,995 --> 01:21:30,144
But when I was born, my
parents gave me this name

1044
01:21:30,156 --> 01:21:35,421
in the hope that I will
continue to grow.healthily.

1045
01:21:35,422 --> 01:21:39,008
Now, I really like this name.

1046
01:21:39,510 --> 01:21:42,053
It's like he was there and saw
everything that was going on, huh?

1047
01:21:42,888 --> 01:21:46,265
I was raised by my
parents and my grandma...

1048
01:21:46,266 --> 01:21:51,229
And also my grandma, they
took care of me with great love.

1049
01:21:51,688 --> 01:21:57,818
When I was a kid and came home
crying, Grandma always comforted me.

1050
01:21:58,403 --> 01:22:03,699
And Grandma always believed what I said.

1051
01:22:04,535 --> 01:22:10,540
When I got zero points,
Mom always scolded me.

1052
01:22:10,541 --> 01:22:15,628
And Father taught me
to try to reach my dreams.

1053
01:22:16,129 --> 01:22:22,802
I grew up with your love.

1054
01:22:22,803 --> 01:22:25,680
And Shizuka's father...

1055
01:22:26,515 --> 01:22:33,062
You once said that I am a person who
understands the pain of other people.

1056
01:22:33,063 --> 01:22:39,026
It's because my family taught me that.

1057
01:22:40,946 --> 01:22:46,575
Maybe I did not become the child my
parents and grandma expected me to be.

1058
01:22:46,576 --> 01:22:55,960
Maybe they expected me to
become a painter or a baseball player.

1059
01:22:55,961 --> 01:22:57,962
Wow, their hopes all failed!

1060
01:22:58,463 --> 01:23:00,006
You're so loud!

1061
01:23:03,844 --> 01:23:07,638
But I can say this one thing.

1062
01:23:07,639 --> 01:23:12,101
I've been raised by a wonderful family.

1063
01:23:12,102 --> 01:23:16,606
Because of that, even
though it can't be expected,

1064
01:23:16,607 --> 01:23:21,110
.. I want to make a
warm family with Shizuka.

1065
01:23:21,111 --> 01:23:25,656
In this regard, I am very confident.

1066
01:23:25,657 --> 01:23:35,333
If I do that, I feel I have returned the
services of my parents and grandma.

1067
01:23:36,126 --> 01:23:39,128
Mother, father.

1068
01:23:39,129 --> 01:23:42,131
Shizuka's Father and Mother.

1069
01:23:42,132 --> 01:23:45,134
We will follow in your footsteps;

1070
01:23:46,428 --> 01:23:47,720
Shizuka.

1071
01:23:48,972 --> 01:23:53,684
Let's make a happy family like them.

1072
01:24:44,861 --> 01:24:46,070
What is wrong?

1073
01:24:49,074 --> 01:24:52,076
No, nothing.

1074
01:25:10,387 --> 01:25:11,846
Are you going home already?

1075
01:25:12,806 --> 01:25:17,226
Grandma has seen enough.

1076
01:25:29,531 --> 01:25:33,743
Looks like Mom was here just now.

1077
01:25:33,744 --> 01:25:35,244
Oh, you feel so too?

1078
01:25:36,455 --> 01:25:41,000
It's -possible that Mom actually came here.

1079
01:26:00,896 --> 01:26:01,937
Nobita.

1080
01:26:03,023 --> 01:26:05,024
Your earlier was fake, right?

1081
01:26:06,276 --> 01:26:09,653
That... er...

1082
01:26:09,654 --> 01:26:13,032
Even though you are better off just you.

1083
01:26:13,033 --> 01:26:16,535
You always hide your own sadness...

1084
01:26:16,536 --> 01:26:22,249
But in the end, you must be
helped by Doraemon again, right?

1085
01:26:28,924 --> 01:26:32,176
I came back for the sake of my happiness.

1086
01:26:32,594 --> 01:26:37,223
With that, Shizuka must also be happy.

1087
01:26:39,893 --> 01:26:41,435
Very good!

1088
01:26:44,356 --> 01:26:46,440
Oh yes. This.

1089
01:26:49,069 --> 01:26:52,196
I want to start all over again.

1090
01:27:44,249 --> 01:27:46,834
OK, we're going home?

1091
01:27:47,711 --> 01:27:48,711
Nobita,

1092
01:27:49,713 --> 01:27:53,674
You really did fulfill Grandma's dream.

1093
01:27:55,176 --> 01:27:56,510
Thank you.

1094
01:27:57,262 --> 01:28:02,141
You're welcome. I'm also grateful for being
able to keep my promise to my grandmother.

1095
01:28:02,142 --> 01:28:07,146
Yes. Grandma is really very happy.

1096
01:28:08,481 --> 01:28:09,523
But...

1097
01:28:10,483 --> 01:28:11,275
But...

1098
01:28:12,152 --> 01:28:17,323
In order to keep Grandma's promise...

1099
01:28:18,742 --> 01:28:30,044
You must have suffered a lot
just to keep Grandma's promise.

1100
01:28:30,045 --> 01:28:35,049
That whiny little Nobita...

1101
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:39,929
To end up being a good boy like this.

1102
01:28:41,514 --> 01:28:49,229
That's what made Grandma the happiest.

1103
01:28:50,482 --> 01:28:51,649
Grandma!

1104
01:28:53,568 --> 01:28:54,943
I'm not like that.

1105
01:28:56,196 --> 01:28:59,615
I'm a stupid coward,

1106
01:28:59,616 --> 01:29:01,575
also a crybaby...

1107
01:29:02,744 --> 01:29:09,041
But Nobita has real strength, right?

1108
01:29:10,585 --> 01:29:19,093
Shizuka must know that too,
that's why she became your bride.

1109
01:29:19,094 --> 01:29:21,220
Grandma!

1110
01:29:21,221 --> 01:29:28,352
Oh, oh, you're back to
being little Nobita again.

1111
01:29:31,106 --> 01:29:33,399
Can I come again?

1112
01:29:35,318 --> 01:29:38,696
You can come no matter how many times.

1113
01:29:38,697 --> 01:29:43,450
Grandma will be waiting for you here.

1114
01:30:03,263 --> 01:30:07,016
So the time machine can drive itself, huh?

1115
01:30:07,017 --> 01:30:11,103
Yes. I'm tired of driving today.

1116
01:30:11,104 --> 01:30:16,900
So many things happened.
It's you, really.

1117
01:30:17,235 --> 01:30:20,237
Hehehe. Sorry, yes, Doraemon.

1118
01:30:20,238 --> 01:30:22,364
Are you really sorry?

1119
01:30:22,365 --> 01:30:23,991
Of course! It's true!

1120
01:30:24,033 --> 01:30:26,160
Really?

1121
01:30:29,497 --> 01:30:31,790
How stubborn, huh!

1122
01:30:35,295 --> 01:30:38,297
Oh, damn it! Forgetful Stick!

1123
01:30:38,298 --> 01:30:43,218
This is bad! Nobita forgot his memory.

1124
01:30:43,219 --> 01:30:45,596
This is really bad, right?

1125
01:30:47,223 --> 01:30:48,515
But wait!

1126
01:30:49,309 --> 01:30:54,313
Nobita, Nobita, Nobita...

1127
01:30:58,651 --> 01:31:04,031
Doraemon?
Why am I riding a time machine?

1128
01:31:04,032 --> 01:31:07,148
You see, we have just
experienced something very

1129
01:31:07,160 --> 01:31:10,287
troublesome, but also
something very beautiful.-

1130
01:31:10,288 --> 01:31:12,956
Eh? What is that? What
is that? Please, tell me!

1131
01:31:12,999 --> 01:31:15,209
When you grow up, you will know.

1132
01:31:15,335 --> 01:31:17,085
Until then, it's better if you don't Know.

1133
01:31:17,253 --> 01:31:20,756
Why is that? What happened?

1134
01:31:20,757 --> 01:31:23,008
How much do you remember?

1135
01:31:23,009 --> 01:31:27,262
Hmm, we met Grandma...

1136
01:31:27,305 --> 01:31:30,724
Oh yes! We have to show
my .bride to Grandma!

1137
01:31:30,725 --> 01:31:33,352
Take it easy. Everything is finished.

1138
01:31:33,603 --> 01:31:38,357
Eh? What does it mean? Tell me please!

1139
01:31:38,399 --> 01:31:41,985
How stubborn, huh! I won't tell!

1140
01:31:41,986 --> 01:31:45,155
